NHL Edge Stats for all NHL Teams - Advanced skating and effort metrics with league percentile context.

![Screenshot placeholder](screenshot.png)

## Overview

Caps Edge displays NHL Edge tracking statistics for all NHL players. Includes skating speed, burst counts, zone time, shot velocity, and a custom Motor Index. Every stat includes a league-wide percentile for comparison. View by team, division, conference, or entire league.

## Features

- **League-Wide Coverage**: View stats for any NHL team, division, conference, or entire league
- **Traditional Stats**: GP, TOI, G, A, P, +/-, Hits, PIM, Shots/60, FO%
- **Edge Stats with Percentiles**:
  - Top skating speed (mph)
  - Bursts over 20 mph and 22 mph
  - Distance skated per game (miles)
  - Offensive/Defensive zone time percentages
  - Zone start percentage
  - Top shot speed (mph)
  - Motor Index (effort relative to position average)
- **Interactive Table**: Click any column to sort
- **Percentile Coloring**: Green for 75th+ percentile, red for below 25th
- **Player Links**: Click any player name to view their Hockey-Reference page
- **Auto-refresh**: Data updates daily at 6 AM ET

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sean-m-sweeney/caps-edge.git
   cd caps-edge
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your API key:
   ```bash
   echo "API_REFRESH_KEY=your-secret-key-here" > .env
   ```

3. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the app at `http://localhost:8000`

The first startup will automatically fetch initial data, which may take a few minutes.

### Manual Installation

1. Install Python 3.11+

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the initial data fetch:
   ```bash
   python scripts/refresh.py
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `API_REFRESH_KEY` | Secret key for manual refresh endpoint | `dev-key-change-me` |
| `TZ` | Timezone for cron scheduling | `America/New_York` |
| `DATA_DIR` | Directory for SQLite database | `./data` |

## API Endpoints

### `GET /api/players`
Returns skaters with full stats and edge stats. Supports filtering:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `team` | Team abbreviation | `?team=WSH` |
| `division` | Division name | `?division=Metropolitan` |
| `conference` | Conference name | `?conference=Eastern` |

If no filters provided, returns all league players.

### `GET /api/players/{player_id}`
Returns a single player with all stats.

### `GET /api/teams`
Returns list of all NHL teams with divisions and conferences.

### `GET /api/divisions`
Returns list of divisions grouped by conference.

### `GET /api/health`
Returns service status and last update timestamp.

### `GET /api/refresh`
Triggers a background data refresh. Requires `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" http://localhost:8000/api/refresh
```

### `GET /api/refresh/sync`
Triggers a synchronous data refresh (waits for completion). Requires `X-API-Key` header.

## Data Refresh Schedule

Data is automatically refreshed once daily via cron:
- **6:00 AM ET**

The refresh fetches Edge stats for all ~850 qualified NHL skaters (10+ games played), so it takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.

You can also trigger a manual refresh using the API endpoint.

## Motor Index Methodology

Motor Index measures player effort relative to position average. Unlike raw stats that favor certain positions, Motor Index compares each player only to others who play the same role.

### Components

| Stat | Weight | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Speed Bursts/60 | 25% | Explosive effort, backchecking, attacking loose pucks |
| Distance/Game | 20% | Total work output, can't fake skating miles |
| Hits/60 | 20% | Physical engagement, finishing checks |
| Shots/60 | 20% | Offensive aggression, creating chances |
| O-Zone Time % | 15% | Sustained pressure, not floating in neutral zone |

### Calculation

Each component is calculated as a ratio to the player's position average:
- A player exactly at average for all stats scores 50
- Scoring above average increases the index
- Scoring below average decreases it

The final score typically ranges from 25-75, with elite effort players reaching 60+.

### Interpreting Scores

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 60+ | Elite motor. Consistently outworks peers. |
| 50-59 | Above average effort for position. |
| 40-49 | Average. Doing what's expected. |
| Below 40 | Below average activity. May indicate skill-over-effort player or limited role. |

### Limitations

- Measures activity, not efficiency or skill
- Does not account for quality of competition
- Players with limited ice time may have inflated per-60 rates
- Requires 10+ games played for inclusion
